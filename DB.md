## Inventory management system
Take example of any home delivery app, from various nearby stores there are various **items** available in specific quantities.

*Scenrio 2: As a user I want to purchase item*

*Scenrio 2: Mutiple users want to purchase same item with limited stock*

*Scenrio 2: User wants to see his order history*
